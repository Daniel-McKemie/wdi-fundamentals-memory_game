      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
      <h3>Why do this?</h3>
      <p>In an age where everything moves at lightning fast speed, your phone constantly sending notifications about this, that, and the other, and all kinds of media available at your fingertips...perhaps it is time to start exercising your brain in a fundamental way again? The game of classic concentration is what that so many of us know, and likely played as kids in some form, and it is known to help with exactly what its namesake is: CONCENTRATION!</p>
